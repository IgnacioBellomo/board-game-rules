                    Board games have evolved a lot over the past few years. A lot of modern games come packing hundreds of components, and with each one of thoes components having 
                    varied effects on the game, rulebooks have become massive tomes that are used as references. It's inefficient to pass around a giant manual for people to 
                    reference all around the table constantly, and flipping through it is a hassle in itself. Digital versions of these rulesets should be more easily accesible, 
                    so that we can spend less time researching ways of handling edge cases and more time playing. First time playthroughs are always a headache, and take twice as long
                    as they should to play. We shouldn't dread that first playthrough, something new should be exciting and fun! Everyone should have their own pocket handbook
                    to reference when they have any doubts as to how to proceed in the game.
